Build instructions for OPSEC.

Quick start:
* Source top-level opsecrc.sh for global OPSEC environment settings.
* To build:
    cp setup.sh.example setup.sh
    # Edit setup.sh and set appropriate environment variables
    ./build.sh all
* To clean:
    ./clean.sh all

Build notes:
* If you run into errors while compiling OpenBLAS with gfortran complaining
  about undefined references to slacgv_, see this page:
    http://icl.cs.utk.edu/lapack-forum/archives/lapack/msg01250.html
  The gist is that you can remove the reference to SLACGV from
    OpenBLAS-git/lappack-3.4.0/SRC/stprfb.f (line 283).
  Then go to the OpenBLAS-git/ directory and run
    make
    make install PREFIX="$OPSEC_ROOT"
