OPSEC - Optimal Power Spectrum Estimation Code

See doc/manual.pdf for a more complete description of what OPSEC does, and how
it does it.  As always, if the documentation appears lacking, use the source!


Quick build instructions:
    ./configure --prefix=PREFIX
    make
    make install
Here PREFIX is the full path where you would like OPSEC libraries and binaries
to be installed, e.g. --prefix=/home/me/coolstuff.  Subdirectories PREFIX/bin,
PREFIX/include, and PREFIX/lib will be created.  The default installation
prefix is /usr/local, which is _not_ recommended.

Run `./configure --help' for a full list of command line options that can be
passed to the configure script.  The most important ones are listed here:
