- allow for multi-file reading/writing in abn code, i.e. to split large files
  up into multiple smaller files
- write more unit tests (especially for models)
- update usage strings in all programs
- figure out runtime scaling for each program, and write a utility to predict
  the runtime of a particular configuration
- allow specifying a configuration prefix on the command line, so that all
  subsequent configuration options have that prefix stripped (mostly useful
  for gmock)
- (LATER) make code more C++ (exception handling, classes for vectors/matrices)
- formalize Impl pattern in helper class, ImplWrapper, and make all XXXImpl
  structs inherit from BaseImpl base class
- clean up logging interface; add ability to log to file (emulating tee), to
  have separate logs per process, etc.
- figure out how to forward declare FILE in SplitFile.h
- augment SplitFile to allow for specifying a maximum file size, honored by
  calls to SplitFile::write()
- DistributedMatrix class using ScaLAPACK
