- allow for multi-file reading/writing in abn code, i.e. to split large files
  up into multiple smaller files
- write more unit tests (especially for models)
- update usage strings in all programs
- look for possible issues with Spline/XiFunc/SelectionFunc and threads
- figure out runtime scaling for each program, and write a utility to predict
  the runtime of a particular configuration
- allow specifying a configuration prefix on the command line, so that all
  subsequent configuration options have that prefix stripped (mostly useful
  for gmock)
- (LATER) make code more C++ (exception handling, classes for vectors/matrices)
