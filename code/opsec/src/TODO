- write more unit tests (especially for models)
- update usage strings in all programs
- figure out runtime scaling for each program, and write a utility to predict
  the runtime of a particular configuration
- allow specifying a configuration prefix on the command line, so that all
  subsequent configuration options have that prefix stripped (mostly useful
  for gmock)
- (LATER) make code more C++ (exception handling, classes for vectors/matrices)
- formalize Impl pattern in helper class, ImplWrapper, and make all XXXImpl
  structs inherit from BaseImpl base class
- clean up logging interface; add ability to log to file (emulating tee), to
  have separate logs per process, etc.
- augment SplitFile to allow for specifying a maximum file size, honored by
  calls to SplitFile::write()
- single comma executable, using ScaLAPACK for matrix multiplication, but with
  option to output matrices in packed or full storage mode
- single estimate executable, using ScaLAPACK
- prefix all OPSEC programs with "opsec-"
- (IMPORTANT) Python program for generating run scripts, with prompts for all
  necessary options
- put cell decomposition information into Survey class
- allow for out-of-tree builds, and make this the default; external packages
  (e.g. OpenBLAS, cfitsio, etc.) should also be built out-of-tree instead of
  being placed in the code/ subdirectory
