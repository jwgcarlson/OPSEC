Programs:
 - basis: produces a set of pre-whitened basis cell functions
 - klt: computes the signal matrix for a set of basis cell functions, then
        computes its largest eigenvalues and eigengvectors
 - dot: computes pixel values by taking the inner product of KL mode functions
        with a galaxy density function
 - comma: computes the derivatives of the covariance matrix with respect to
          model parameters (band powers, etc.)
- estimate: computes parameter estimates

Schematically, the workflow goes like this:

  (selection function) => basis => klt => (KL mode functions) => comma => dot => estimate => (results)
                                    /\                                     /\
                                    ||                                     ||
                        (prior correlation function)                   (galaxies)

Conventions used throughout code:
- When spherical coordinates are used, 3-dimensional positions are represented
  by a triple (r,mu,phi), where
      0 <= r < infty  is the distance from the origin,
     -1 <= mu <= 1    is the cosine of the polar angle measured from the north pole,
      0 <= phi < 2*pi is the azimuthal angle.
  Cartesian coordinates may be constructed in the usual way as
    x = r*sqrt(1 - mu*mu)*cos(phi),
    y = r*sqrt(1 - mu*mu)*sin(phi),
    z = r*mu.
- When Cartesian coordinates are used, 3-dimensional positions are represented
  by a triple (x,y,z).
- Distances (including dimensionful coordinates) are measured in units of
  Mpc/h, unless otherwise noted.
- Integer indices a,b indicate cells: 0 <= a,b < Ncells.
- Integer indices i,j indicate KL modes: 0 <= i,j < Nmodes.
- Integer indices m,n indicate parameters: 0 <= m,n < Nparams.
