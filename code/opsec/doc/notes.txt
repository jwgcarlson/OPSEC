Implementation notes:

- In the ComputeLocalSignalMatrix() routine, I now take advantage of the fact
that the signal matrices are symmetric by not recomputing $S_{ab}$ if $S_{ba}$
has already been computed locally.  This might not seem like a very significant
optimization when spread over many processes, since only nloc*(nloc-1)/2 out of
nloc*n matrix element computations are actually eliminated, so that the
fractional improvement decreases as the number of processes increases.
However, it is precisely the matrix elements near the diagonal that are the
most difficult to compute, since these elements tend to represent pairs of
cells that are spatially close, where the correlation function is most rapidly
varying.  So the savings introduced by this optimization can be significant.

- Single precision mode (--with-precision=single) hasn't been tested thoroughly
(or at all).  I can't think of a reason why it shouldn't work, but the need for
it hasn't arisen yet.
