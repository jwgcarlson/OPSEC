This is an autotoolized distribution of the ARPACK software package.  The
official source distribution is available online at
    http://www.caam.rice.edu/software/ARPACK/
This distribution adds scripts that enable ARPACK (and its parallel cousin
PARPACK) to be built using the standard `configure && make && make install'
recipe for installing software on Unix-like platforms.


***** Quick installation instructions:

    ./configure --prefix=<install_prefix>
    make
    make install

This will install the libraries libarpack.a and libparpack.a to the
<install_prefix>/lib directory.  (If you choose not to `make install', and
instead would like to manually copy them to their final destination, note that
the actual `.a' static libraries will be hidden in a `.libs/' sub-directory of
the respective source directories.)


***** Detailed installation instructions:

    ./configure [OPTIONS]
    make
    make install

The full list of options can be examined by running
    ./configure --help=recursive
The most relevant options are:
    --prefix=<install_prefix>   install libraries to <install_prefix>/lib
    --disable-shared            produce only .a libraries, not .so
    --disable-parpack           install only libarpack.a, not the parallelized libparpack.a
    F77=<my_f77>                compile ARPACK using my_f77 instead of the default compiler
    MPIF77=<my_mpif77>          compile PARPACK using my_mpif77 instead of the default MPI compiler
    FFLAGS=<my_fflags>          add the specified flags to the compile command (e.g. -O9)

Examples:
    # Example 1: install both libraries to $HOME/lib
    ./configure --prefix=$HOME --disable-shared
    make
    make install

    # Example 2: compile ARPACK only and copy to the top-level source directory
    ./configure --disable-parpack
    make
    cp ARPACK/SRC/.libs/libarpack.a .
