Simple code to generate a Poisson sampling of a Gaussian random field with
given power spectrum.


gmock: generates mock galaxy catalog by taking a Poisson sampling of a Gaussian
random density field

gcorr: estimates the observed correlation function for a given cosmology and
survey geometry by taking repeated Poisson samplings from a Gaussian random
density field
