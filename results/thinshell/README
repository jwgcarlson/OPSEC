Tests of klt using a thin spherical shell for the survey volume.  In this case,
the KL modes should be the real spherical harmonics, in an order determined
by the Legendre coefficients $a_n$ of the function
  f(x) = \xi( R \sqrt{2*(1-x)} )
       = \sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n P_n(x) ,
where R is the radius of the shell.

As of 9 March 2012, this test case is working properly.
