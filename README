This is OPSEC: an Optimal Power Spectrum Estimator Code.


Quick start for OPSEC:

- From the top level directory, edit opsecrc.sh and make any necessary changes.
  In particular, choose the installation directory OPSEC_ROOT.  The default is
  to build and install OPSEC in place (i.e. with OPSEC_ROOT set to the location
  of this README file).

- Source opsecrc.sh to set the appropriate environment variables.
  $ . opsecrc.sh

- Change to the code/ directory, and follow the README there for building OPSEC
  and its dependent libraries.  This will produce the following directory
  structure under $OPSEC_ROOT:
    $OPSEC_ROOT/bin     : binaries and scripts
    $OPSEC_ROOT/lib     : libraries
    $OPSEC_ROOT/include : header files

- Move to the tests/ directory and pick a few test runs to try.

- A manual (minimal at present, but improving) can be found at
    doc/manual.pdf
